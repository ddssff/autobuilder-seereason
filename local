Comment:  The definitions in local specify particular hostnames to upload to,
  the vendor name to use when constructing the version numbers, the host names
  of repository mirrors, and anything else site specific or likely to change.

  These Let values above need to be adjusted for the repository you
  will be uploading to.  If you are only building packages and don't
  plan to upload them to a repository, you still need to set
  upload-host and upload-repo.  This is necessary to ensure that
  packages you build do not conflict with packages already in the
  repository you are building against.

  These are some specific host names we use building the sources.list,
  adjust according to your location.  When setting the same value more
  than once, the first Let takes precedence over the second.

  Extra-Package: seereason-keyring
Comment: When initializing a new release, this extra package may need to be
	 commented out until it has been built and uploaded.  At that point
	 the build environment can be recreated with --flush-root, or it can
	 be installed by hand using chroot and apt-get.
