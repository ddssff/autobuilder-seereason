This is a configuration directory for the autobuilder.  Link your
~/.autobuilder.d to here, and modify it as you wish.  It requires
autobuilder library version 5.2 or later.  The old style configuration
files have moved into the attic subdirectory.

# Upgrading libraries bundled with GHC

To install a new version of a library bundled with GHC, the debian name
needs to be different from the one GHC conflicts with.  This needs to be
done globally, not just in the specific package, so other packages that
depend on the renamed one will compute the right debian dependencies.
In Debian.AutoBuilder.Details.Versions there is a list of such renamings.
There you can specify the new base name for the package (the part between
libghc- and -dev) and at what version that new name takes effect.
