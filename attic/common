Comment: Unlike the autobuilder, it is not Debian policy to rebuild a
  package every time any of its build dependencies change.  These rules
  specify a collection of packages which will not trigger a rebuild of
  (basically) everything.

Name: all-sources
Use: debian-sources
Extra-Package: debian-archive-keyring
Use: ubuntu-sources
Use: extra-sources
Comment: The debian-archive-keyring package must be installed to get smooth
  installations of packages from the debian archive, so we want it installed
  when creating a build environment.

Name: build
Strictness: moderate
Extra-Essential: gnupg dpkg
Comment:
  The gnupg package is required for apt-get update to check signatures.  The
  freespire-archive-keyring package supplies the keys to verify our archives.
