  This directory is an example configuration for the autobuilder, for
  documentation and testing.  It is also the configuration file used
  for the seereason.org repository.  To try it, create a link to here
  from ~/.autobuilder.d.  You will also need to edit "local" to set
  your own upload host and user.
  .
  The program first reads in all the files in this directory.  It then looks
  at the command line options for an argument which correspond to a section
  in the configuration with that value in the "Name:" parameter.  This section
  then becomes the run time configuration after expansions are performed on
  it: whenever a "Use:" parameter is found, it is replaced by the section with
  the corresponding "Name:" parameter, and this is repeated recursively until
  no "Use:" parameters remain.
