autobuilder-seereason (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Target updates
  * Add dependencies due to some of the debian/Debianize.hs scripts of the
    targets.  These scripts are run before the package build starts, so
    theys aren't dependencies of the package, they are dependencies of our
    version of the autobuilder, autobuilder-seereason.  The more I think
    about it the more correct this seems.

autobuilder-seereason (1.0) unstable; urgency=low
