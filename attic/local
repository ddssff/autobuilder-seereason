Comment:  The definitions in local specify particular hostnames to upload to,
  the vendor name to use when constructing the version numbers, the host names
  of repository mirrors, and anything else site specific or likely to change.

Comment:
  The Let values for upload-host and upload-repo need to be set to the
  repository to which the packages will be uploaded.  Even if you are
  building packages you don't plan to upload them, the values are still
  required so the autobuilder canensure that the packages it builds do
  not conflict with packages already in the repository.

Comment:
  These are some specific host names we use building the sources.list,
  adjust according to your location.  When setting the same value more
  than once, the first Let takes precedence over the second.

  Extra-Package: seereason-keyring
Comment: When initializing a new release, this extra package may need to be
	 commented out until it has been built and uploaded.  At that point
	 the build environment can be recreated with --flush-root, or it can
	 be installed by hand using chroot and apt-get.
