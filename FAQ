Q0. How do you run the autobuilder?

A0. generally, I install autobuilder-seereason, check out autobuilder-seereason, cabal build it, then say
    dist/build/autobuilder-seereason/autobuilder-seereason trusty-seereason --pattern ghcjs --do-upload --do-newdist

Q1.  How do I build a target that isn't checked into a VCS, just
     a directory on my local machine?

A1.  Build the target using the dir function in
     Debian.AutoBuilder.Types.Packages.  Please don't upload anything
     built from such a target, though, check it in and build again.
